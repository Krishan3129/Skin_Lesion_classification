Skin cancer poses a significant risk to human health globally, with melanoma being the most aggressive and deadly type. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and improving patient survival rates. \proposed two-branched method combines a three-stage 2D-Fourier-Bessel series expansion-based empirical wavelet transform (2D-FBSE-EWT) with a convolutional autoencoder for enhanced skin lesion analysis.
\The 2D-FBSE-EWT branch is utilized for spatial processing and signal decomposition into distinct frequency 
bands. This branch also incorporates statistical features, 2D-Taege-Kaiser energy, and 2Dfractal dimension features, which help in identifying skin lesions are malignant or nonmalignant.
The other branch employs a convolutional autoencoder to extract bottleneck layer features, 
which are then combined with the 2D-FBSE-EWT features. This integration of spatial 
processing, signal decomposition, and deep learning techniques enables the method to 
classify skin lesions more accurately. Additionally, different classifiers are analyzed for 
the feature matrix to enhance classification performance. By leveraging these advanced 
features and methodologies, the proposed method aims to improve the early detection and 
diagnosis of melanoma, ultimately aiding in better patient outcomes.
